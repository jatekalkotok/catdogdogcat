We're making a game for [#GitHubGameOff](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GitHubGameOff) using pygame...

The concept is a hybrid cat-dog animal collecting falling cat/dog treats.

The game is written in python 3, so on older systems you may have to substitute the python command for python3.

The only external dependency is the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org) library itself, if you don't have it installed yet run the following (preferably within a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)):

    pip install -r requirements.txt

To start the game, run the main file:

    python main.py
